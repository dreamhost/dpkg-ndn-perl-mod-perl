Subject: [PATCH] Make sure authn and authz providers are cleaned up in time

The authn and authz providers need to be registered in the configuration
pool rather than the server process pool.  The latter outlives the load
time of the mod_perl shared object, so cleanup hooks could get called
after the registered functions were unloaded, causing SIGSEGVs and other
undefined behaviour.

Fix suggested by Stefan Fritsch.
